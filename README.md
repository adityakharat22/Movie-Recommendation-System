# Movie-recommendtion-system-Machine-learning-project
Welcome to MovieRecommenderML, an exciting project that leverages machine learning to provide personalized movie recommendations tailored just for you! This repository houses the codebase and resources for building and deploying a sophisticated movie recommendation system.

#Project Overview:
This project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and historical movie data. By employing collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques, MovieRecommenderML ensures that users receive accurate and personalized movie suggestions.

#Features:
1.Collaborative Filtering:

User-User Collaborative Filtering: Discover movies liked by users with similar tastes.
Item-Item Collaborative Filtering: Identify movies similar to those already enjoyed by the user.
Content-Based Filtering:

Analyze movie features such as genre, actors, and directors to recommend similar content.
Matrix Factorization:

Implement matrix factorization techniques to uncover latent features and enhance recommendation accuracy.
2.Scalability:

Design the system to handle a large number of users and movies efficiently.
3.Web Interface:

Develop a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction with the recommendation system.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core language for machine learning model development.
streamlit: Framework for developing the web-based user interface.
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Supporting machine learning utilities.
